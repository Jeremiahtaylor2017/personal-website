                    I'm Jeremiah! üëãüèΩ I've recently grauated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Coding Bootcamp and have a background in IT and security.
                    I attended the United States Air Force Academy and Graduated from CSU, Sacramento in 2017 with a degree in Economics. I'm passionate about building something from nothing 
                    and a special interest in what's going on behind the scenes of applications we use every day. Building full stack applications with creative solutions fuels my desire to learn
                    and I bring my background of networking, infrastructure, and application management into every application I write.
